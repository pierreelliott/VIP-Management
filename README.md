# VIP Management

Web application to manage VIPs and Actions made for them (repainting a wall, bringing more toilet paper, ...).

It features a simple (and voluntarily not secure) authentication system.

There is no option to add, modify or remove login or password from a user. Currently, the only way to do it is to manually add it in the database.

A default user is provided with the following credentials :

* Login : admin
* Password : admin

(Very spiritual, I know)

# Installation

First, you need a web server (like Apache) with a MySQL database.

Then, you need to import the database provided in the `BDD_VIP.sql`

And you're good to go!
